- Most of your memory will likely go to textures, so the import settings here are **critical**. In general, try to follow these guidelines:
  - **Lower the Max Size**: Use the minimum settings that produce visually acceptable results. This is non-destructive and can quickly reduce your texture memory.
  - **Use powers of two (POT)**: Unity requires POT texture dimensions for mobile texture compression formats (PVRCT or ETC).
  - **Atlas your textures**: Placing multiple textures into a single texture can reduce draw calls and speed up rendering. Use the Unity Sprite Atlas or the third-party TexturePacker to atlas your textures.
  - **Toggle off the Read/Write Enabled option**: When enabled, this option creates a copy in both CPU- and GPU-addressable memory, doubling the textureâ€™s memory footprint. In most cases, keep this disabled. If you are generating textures at runtime, enforce this via Texture2D.Apply, passing in makeNoLongerReadable set to true.
  - **Disable unnecessary Mip Maps**: Mip Maps are not needed for textures that remain at a consistent size on-screen, such as 2D sprites and UI graphics (leave Mip Maps enabled for 3D models that vary their distance from the camera).
  - **Compress Texture**: For almost every mobile device today, format sould be **RGBA Compressed ASTC**. For older devices, you can choose **ET2** or **ETC** compress.
